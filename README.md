# Pokemon_Battle_Factory
Creation of a Pokemon Battle Frontier, Battle Factory Game. This is primarily done as an excersise in improving my software design abilities, however there are some potentially interesting applications of this.

_The goals of this project are as follows (as of Nov 2020):_
  1) Improve my own knowledge of programming by creating standalone, robust scripts that can emulate a pokemon battle (in progress)
  2) Make a simple battle factory text-based game that 1 or 2 players can play in, based on the actual pokemon mechanics (in progress)
  3) Import a set of 40 pokemon so players can make their own battle factory teams (TBD)
  4) Create a random-playing agent that selects actions at random (TBD)
  5) Create a minimax or expectimax AI that can play the game (TBD)
  6) Create a Q-learning agent that can play the game (TBD)
  7) Try a deep learning agent to play the game (TBD)
  8) Create an actual UI to learn about user-interface driven programming for the game (TBD)
  9) Host this on a website to learn about web development and hosting via code (TBD)
  10) Take the AI agents that I've made, and use them in the Pokemon Showdown online game to see how well they perform (TBD)
